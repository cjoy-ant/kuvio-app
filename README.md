### Pending Features

#### Error Boundary

- Ideally, error boundaries would have been implemented throughout the app to inform the user of any UI or server errors; however due to time constraints, this was not included.

#### ADD / EDIT / DELETE customers, projects, and project assignments

- The API has been developed to respond to these endpoints, but features have not yet been implemented on the client-side.

#### Complete testing of all components and endpoints

- Due to time contraints, this app has not been fully tested
